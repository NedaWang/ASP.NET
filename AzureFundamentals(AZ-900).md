# Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)

### Benefits and Considerations of Using Cloud Services
**High Availability (HA)**: System are available for long periods of time with little or no disruption. It's not backup or disaster recovery, or high performance, or load balancing.\
**Scalability (scale-up)**: Increase workload on current resources. \
**Elasticity (scale-out)**:  Increase workload on additional resources. Scale-in means removing those additional resources.\
**Agility**: How quickly the resources respond to changes, such us provision or decommission cloud services in minutes using self-service.\
**Disaster Recovery**: The ability to recover from a failure, such as backups for virtual machines or SQL databases.\
**Capital Expenses (CapEx)**: Pay upfront costs, including servers, storage, networking backup, personnel, etc.\
**Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: It is associated with cloud services, ongoing billing costs. It is great for agile environments where demand is unpredictable. \
**Consumption-Based Model**: A cloud service provider's model. Pay for what is consumed, no upfront costs, stop paying for services no longer required. 

### Categories of cloud
**Iaas**: Infrastructure as a servise. Services hosted by a cloud service provider, They take care of that storage, the servers, the networking, the buildings and the skilled personnel. (eg: Azure Virtual Machine) Services provider is responsible for the infrastructure and customer is respinsible for the operating systems, configuration, backups and so on.\
**PaaS**: Platform as a servise. Prebuilt services provided by the service provider.(eg: Azure SQL)  Service provider is responsible for infrastructure, OS, management, backups. Customer is responsible for their application itself.\
**Saas**: Software as a servise. Software that is centrally hosted by the cloud service provider. (eg: Gmail) Typically requires subcription. Service provider is responsible for the application and all the nderlying infrastructure.\
**Baas**: Backup as a servise\
**Daas**: Database as a servise\
**IDaas**: Identity as a servise\

**Serverless**: Serverless computing allows developers to build apps without worrying about the underlying resources. Cloud provider is responsible for provisioning, scaling, and managing. Scale dynamically. Faster to market.
